User personas
--------------

In this project I am creating a game for the pizza company called Little Wing. One of the first task I had to do was to create a user persona. The reason user personas are so valuable at the begining of a project is becasue it allows the developer to fully understand the target audience. Doing this research at the begining leads to a better approach to the app and means a better idea can be created that suits the started
